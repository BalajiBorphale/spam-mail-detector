# Spam Email Detector Chrome Extension
**[Live Demo 🚀](https://smdetector-ui.onrender.com/)**

## Overview
The **Spam Email Detector** is a Chrome extension that allows users to detect whether an email is spam or not by using a trained machine learning model. The model is hosted on a Flask server deployed via Render and can classify an email as "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on the content.


## Features
- **Spam Detection**: Quickly determine if an email is spam or not.
- **Lightweight Extension**: Simply paste email text into the extension and get results.
- **Real-time API**: Sends the email content to a Flask backend hosted on Render, which classifies the email using a Naive Bayes model.
- **Modern Chrome Extension**: Built with Manifest Version 3.

## How It Works
1. **Enter the Email Content**: Paste the email body into the extension popup.
2. **Spam Check**: The extension sends the email text to the backend API hosted on Render.
3. **Get Results**: The server returns whether the email is spam or not, and the extension displays the result.
